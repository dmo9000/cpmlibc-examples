you have it, <A HREF="mailto:gaby@gaby.de?subject=CPM sources">please drop me a line</A>,
and I will provide you an address where to send it.
It will then be posted here so everybody can enjoy it.<BR>

<P><A HREF="download/plm80s.zip">PLM compiler source</A> : 90K Here is the
source to the Intel PLM compiler. It is written in Fortran (66), and is supposed
to be pretty clean.<BR>
It compiles correctly with gcc's g77 on Linux.
However, it is not the version required to compile CP/M 2.2 or 3.0. It
works well, but lacks support for external definitions and some PLM
constructs, as required by the DR source.

<P><A HREF="download/plm2c.zip">PLM to C translator</A> : 406K Here is the
source for a PLM to C translator. I believe it is written in C, and was targeted
for unix type systems. It may be able to compile with Turbo C, but will need
some work. There is a lot of text in with the source code that is not surrounded
with &quot;/* */&quot; C comment delimiters. If someone gets it to compile,
please send it back to me so I can post the fixed version. This package is GNU,
so enjoy.</P>

<A HREF="download/vaxplm.zip">PL/M VAX compiler</A> : 210K 
This archive contains the sources for a PL/M-VAX compiler and
the command files necessary to build the compiler from scratch.
<BR>I have been told that it looks
like parts of the PL/M compiler are actually written in PL/M itself,
so there's a bootstrap problem. If you have the missing executable, please
let me know.
<BR>Another comment I recently received: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is indeed one PL/M file, control.plm, that is a part of the compiler.
However, there is also a file, control.tmp, that looks like control.plm
translated to VAX assembly, possibly by the compiler itself. My guess is
therefore that as long as there is a decent FORTRAN compiler and an
assembler on the VAX, the PL/M compiler should build.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are some BIOS/BDOS/CCP sources in here, but all seem to be revisions
of version 1.1 of the OS.
<BR>
The bulk of the code looks like revisions of Alcyon C (compiler, assembler,
linker and libraries). As far as I can see, this compiler emits 68K
assembler and should run under CP/M-68K, REGULUS, VMS on a VAX and Unix on a
PDP-11.

If you like to port CP/M-8000 to another (non-Olivetti) machine,
you must consider that you need to do the first build on
an Olivetti M20 running CP/M-8000. Dwight Elvey is willing to assemble and 
link programs for those that want to bring up CPM-8000 on
some other machine, with his Olivetti. He can except
text source files for the bios over the net.

<A HREF="download/8k0583.zip">P-CP/M-Z8K SOURCES</A> : 656K
These are the C sources for a CP/M-8000 version from May 5, 1983 and
October 20, 1983. Version number unknown, possibly 1.0. Some sources 
contain the string &quot;P-CP/M for the Olivetti M20 (Z8001)&quot;. Included is
the BIOS for the Olivetti M20 Z8001 and adaptions for the Kontron Z8002.
Also included is a set of manuals in TEX format.
<BR>Here are some comments I recently received regarding this and the two
following archives:
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Reading 'bdos/bdosmisc.c' reveals: "CPM-Z8000 Version 1.2 03/14/83". This
file seems to be the usual place for version and copyright strings in CP/M's
written in C.
<BR>
In the same archive, 'newos/bdosmisc.c' says "CPM-Z8000 Version 1.3
06/14/83". Sad, really, that 'newos/bdosmain.c' is the cut-down 'loader'
version of the BDOS. Sadder still that BDOSMA.C in cpm8k13.zip is also the
loader BDOS.
<BR>
Might as well dip into cpm8k11, then...
<OL>
 <LI> The BIOS (source) is for the Olivetti M20.
 <LI> There's no source for BDOS and utils.
 <LI> There is a C compiler: "Zilog CP/M-Z8000 C Compiler v1.01e 12/26/84". In
the readme on disk 4 it is claimed that the -D option is broken on this
version. Clearly not good.
