/* 
 *  From http://www.tassos-oak.com/NB2/toolbook.html
 *  The BDOS is located at some address in high storage; that is, it begins at an address higher than the end of our program.
 *  We don't know what that address is. It varies from system to system, and it can vary from one command to the next in a single
 *  system, although it normally doesn't. However, there is always a jump instruction at location 5 (address 0005h) which is
 *  aimed at the lowest instruction in the BDOS.
 *  To call upon the BDOS, we need only place the correct arguments in registers and call location 5.
 *
 *  One BDOS argument is a service number that specifies what we want done. It is always passed in register C.
 *  The other argument depends on the service being requested, but if it's a byte, it is passed in register E, and if a word, in DE.
 *  The second argument is the byte to be typed; it's passed in register E.
